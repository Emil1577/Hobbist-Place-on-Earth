## Description 📖

MERN-stack single-page application, with a scalable MongoDB back end, a GraphQL API, and an Express.js and Node.js server with a React front end, implementing user authentication with JWT to build a user-focused platform.

✅Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

✅Include authentication (JWT).

✅Protect sensitive API key information on the server.

✅Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class and id naming conventions, indentation, high-quality comments, and so on).

✅Have a high-quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).
